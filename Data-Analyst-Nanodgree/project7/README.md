## Ford GoBike Dataset

> This project explores a dataset containing bike trip in 2017 and 2018 with 14 attributes for 2480701 trips with 13 features or attributes. In order to start the analysis process I have used Python, Pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn libraries. These libraries helps to explore the datasetâ€™s variables and structure of the data. It helps me to do data visualization, finding the patterns and relationships between features in this dataset.


## Summary of Findings

> 1. Finding the average of trip times
> 2. Finding the Monthly bike ride trend and average trip times.
> 3. Finding the stations that have more interest to start the trips at them.
>By analyzing the dataset for two years(2017-2018), I found that 84% of the subscribers are bike riders and the remaining 16% are customers. Also, the average number of customer trips is approximately 12 minutes, which is approximately one-third of the customer trips, which are an average of 34 minutes. Also, trips in certain months of the year increase by a very large rate. The use of bikes in the San Francisco area of both stations(1and 2), which represents nearly 100,000 trips. This may be a sign of a lack of public transportation or congestion of cars, so they prefer biking.


## Key Insights for Presentation

> In the presentation part, I focused on the main variable of my interest which is the duration of the trips. I started my slide-show with the visualization part of that variable as part of univariate.  I choose a histogram plot to visualize this variable. For the first time visualization, it was needed to log transformation to get a better result. Then I find the common month for biking. The visualization done with a histogram plot. Using a pie chart to show the percentage of types of users.  After that, I pulled other categorical variables, in bivariate and multivariate using scatter plot. In order to make the graph understandable, each plot has been polished with title, axes labels and I use some colors to depict the values of the multiple variables on the plot.
